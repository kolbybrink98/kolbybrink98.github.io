# Welcome to My New Blog!

Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm Kolby Brink, a data analytics and visualization consultant specializing in Power BI dashboards. I'm also a laboratory technician for the Quantitative Analysis Research Core, where I apply analytical techniques to research in biomechanics and movement science.

I created this blog to share my knowledge, experiences, and insights in the field of data analytics. Whether you're a fellow data professional, a researcher looking to enhance your analytical skills, or someone curious about the world of data visualization, I hope you'll find value in what I share here.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be covering a variety of topics including:

- **Power BI Best Practices**: Tips, tricks, and tutorials for creating effective dashboards
- **Data Visualization Techniques**: Principles of good visualization and how to apply them
- **Case Studies**: Real-world examples of analytics projects and their impact
- **Research Insights**: Interesting findings from my work in biomechanics and movement analysis
- **Career Development**: Reflections on building a career that spans both technical and research domains

## My Background

My journey into data analytics began during my research in biomechanics, where I discovered the power of visualizing complex movement data to uncover insights that weren't apparent in raw numbers. This led me to develop expertise in Power BI and other analytics tools, which I now use both in my research and consulting work.

I'm particularly interested in the intersection of data science and human movement, using nonlinear analysis methods to understand patterns in how we move and coordinate our actions.
